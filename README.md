HATEOS and SSE for .NET (Boomers only)

## What is boomer-sse?
boomer-sse is a .NET library (with a companion JavaScript 
library)
which encourages you to use HATEOS and 
Server-Sent Events (SSE) in a loosely-coupled and 
reactive way.

In other words, Stop using React.

## Why "boomer"
- .NET is by far and away the greatest stack ever created (at the time of writing)
- Boomers love .NET
- Reactive front-ends are actually great
- Loosely-coupled systems are easier to maintain
- HATEOS is the future of web development 
(if you are a boomer)
- The people behind [HTMX](https://htmx.org/) and 
[Datastar](https://data-star.dev/) are unhinged maniacs 
and should not be trusted
